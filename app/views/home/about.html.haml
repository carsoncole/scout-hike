    A Scout pledges to keep themself physically strong, and mentally awake, so let's hike! And we'll make it more fun by doing it at night.

    .emphasis The goal is to hike a total of 10 miles in February.

    Go out between the hours of 5-11pm, take a flashlight, and walk with a sibling or parent. Once you return, log it here so you can track your progress.
